==API Reference==
GTFock provides a flexible interface for constructing Fock matrices on distributed systems. The

==Example SCF code==
GTFock also includes an example SCF code, which demonstrates how to use GTFock to build a non-trivial quantum chemistry application.

The example SCF code can be run as
mpirun -np <nprocs> ./scf <basis> <xyz> <nprow> <npcol> <np2> <ntasks> <niters>

# NOTE: nprow x npcol must be equal to nprocs
# NOTE: np2 x np2 x np2 must be smaller than nprocs
# NOTE: suggested values for ntasks: 3, 4, 5

# <nprocs>: number of MPI processes
# <basis>:  basis file
# <xyz>:    xyz file
# <nprow>:  number of MPI processes per row
# <npcol>:  number of MPI processes per col
# <np2>: number of MPI processes per one dimension for purification (eigenvalue solve)
# <ntasks>: each MPI process has ntasks x ntasks tasks
# <niters>: number of SCF iterations

# For example, the following command run the SCF code on graphene_12_54_114.xyz
# with 12 MPI processes for 10 iterations. The number of processes used for
# purification is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.
