==API Reference==
GTFock provides a flexible interface for constructing Fock matrices on distributed systems. The

==Example SCF code==
GTFock also includes an example SCF code, which demonstrates how to use GTFock to build a non-trivial quantum chemistry application.

The example SCF code can be run as
{{{
mpirun -np <nprocs> ./scf <basis> <xyz> <nprow> <npcol> <np2> <ntasks> <niters>
}}}
 * *nprocs*: the number of MPI processes
 * *basis*:  the basis file
 * *xyz*:    the xyz file
 * *nprow*:  the number of MPI processes per row
 * *npcol*:  the number of MPI processes per col
 * *np2*: the number of MPI processes per one dimension for purification (eigenvalue solve)
 * *ntasks*: the each MPI process has ntasks x ntasks tasks
 * *niters*: the number of SCF iterations
 
*NOTE*
 # *nprow* x *npcol* must be equal to nprocs
 # *np2* x *np2 x *np2* must be smaller than nprocs
 # suggested values for *ntasks*: 3, 4, 5

For example, the following command run the SCF code on graphene_12_54_114.xyz with 12 MPI processes for 10 iterations. The number of processes used for purification is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.
{{{
mpirun -np 12 ./pscf/scf data/guess/cc-pvdz.gbs data/graphene/graphene_12_54_114.xyz 3 4 2 4 10
}}}
